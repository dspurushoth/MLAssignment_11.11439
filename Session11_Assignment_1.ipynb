    "<b>Answer:</b><br>\n",
    "<b>Ensemble methods :</b> is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model. Ensemble is the art of combining diverse set of learners (individual models) together to improvise on the stability and predictive power of the model.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Here are the top 4 reasons for a model to be different. They can be different because of a mix of these factors as well:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. Difference in population\n",

    "2. Difference in hypothesis\n",

    "<b>Error in Ensemble Learning</b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>Bias error</b> is useful to quantify how much on an average are the predicted values different from the actual value. A high bias error means we have a under-performing model which keeps on missing important trends.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Variance</b> on the other side quantifies how are the prediction made on same observation different from each other. A high variance model will over-fit on your training population and perform badly on any observation beyond training. Following diagram will give you more clarity (Assume that red spot is the real value and blue dots are predictions) \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b> Bagging:</b> Bagging tries to implement similar learners on small sample populations and then takes a mean of all the predictions. In generalized bagging, you can use different learners on different population.  As you can expect this helps us to reduce the variance error.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Boosing:</b>Boosting is an iterative technique which adjust the weight of an observation based on the last classification. If an observation was classified incorrectly, it tries to increase the weight of this observation and vice versa. Boosting in general decreases the bias error and builds strong predictive models. However, they may sometimes over fit on the training data.\n",

    "<b>Answer:</b>\n",
    "Following are the commonly used methodologies :\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1.Cross-Validation :</b> Cross Validation in its simplest form is a one round validation, where we leave one sample as in-time validation and rest for training the model. But for keeping lower variance a higher fold cross validation is preferred.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2.Early Stopping : </b>Early stopping rules provide guidance as to how many iterations can be run before the learner begins to over-fit.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3.Pruning : </b>Pruning is used extensively while building CART models. It simply removes the nodes which add little predictive power for the problem in hand.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4.Regularization :</b> It introduces a cost term for bringing in more features with the objective function. Hence, it tries to push the coefficients for many variables to zero and hence reduce cost term."
